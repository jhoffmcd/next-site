import Layout from '~/components/Layout'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Clean URLs with Route Masking',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'clean-urls-with-route-masking'
}

In the previous lesson, we learned how to create dynamic pages with query strings.
With that, a link to one of our blog posts looks like this:

http://localhost:3000/post?title=Hello%20Next.js

But that URL doesn't look nice.
How about if we had something like this?

http://localhost:3000/p/hello-nextjs

It would be awesome, right?
That's exactly what we are trying to do with this lesson.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
