## Exporting Other Pages

Now, let's try to export all the other pages as well.

For that, add the following content to the `next.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  exportPathMap: function() {
    return {
      '/': { page: '/' },
      '/about': { page: '/about' },
      '/p/hello-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'Hello Next.js' } },
      '/p/learn-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'Learn Next.js is awesome' } },
      '/p/deploy-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'Deploy apps with Zeit' } }
    }
  }
}
```

As is shown in the above config, the `/about` path is very similar to the `/` path. But the others are a bit different.

Here's what's going on here:

To render blog posts in our app, we've got a single page called `/post`. We pass different content to that page via query strings.
So, we need to provide those query strings when we are exporting our app too.

That's what we are doing with the above config for all the pages starting with `/p/`.

Now close the existing app running with serve and run the following commands in your app root:

```bash
npm run build
npm run export
cd out
serve -p 8080
```

Now you'll be able to access the following page without any issues:

http://localhost:8080/p/learn-nextjs/

---

Let's do a simple task.

Add the following content to your config:

```js
'/p/exporting-pages': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'Learn to Export HTML Pages' } }
```

Our final config will now look like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  exportPathMap: function() {
    return {
      '/': { page: '/' },
      '/about': { page: '/about' },
      '/p/hello-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'Hello Next.js' } },
      '/p/learn-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'Learn Next.js is awesome' } },
      '/p/deploy-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'Deploy apps with Zeit' } },
      '/p/exporting-pages': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'Learn to Export HTML Pages' } }
    }
  }
}
```

Then close the current "serve" instance and run the following commands in the app root:

```bash
npm run export
cd out
serve -p 8080
```

Now try to access this page: http://localhost:8080/p/exporting-pages/.
What's the output of the page?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
