import Layout from '~/components/Layout'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Clean URLs with Route Masking',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'clean-urls-with-route-masking',
  stepId: 'setup'
}

## Setup

First of all, we need a simple Next.js app to play with. Try to download the following example app:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zeit/next-learn-demo.git
cd next-learn-demo
cd 4-clean-urls
```

You can run it with:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now you can access the app by navigating to http://localhost:3000/.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
