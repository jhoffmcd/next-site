## Fetch Data in Client Side

Here we can only see the message on the browser console.
That's because we navigated to the post page via the client side. Then fetching data from the client side is the best way to do it.

If you just visit a post page directly (eg:- http://localhost:3000/p/975) you'll be able to see the message printed on the server but not in the client.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
