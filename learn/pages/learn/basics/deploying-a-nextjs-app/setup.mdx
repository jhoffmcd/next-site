import Layout from '~/components/Layout'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Deploying a Next.js App',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'deploying-a-nextjs-app',
  stepId: 'setup'
}

First of all, we need a simple Next.js app to play with. Try to download the following example app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeit/next-learn-demo.git
cd next-learn-demo
cd 8-deploying
```

You can run it with:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now you can access the app by navigating to http://localhost:3000.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
