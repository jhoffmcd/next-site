## No Need to Always Build

As you've seen, we can access the page without any issues. That page is not available in the `/` page, but we were able to generate the static HTML for it.

That's because the exporting HTML is totally controlled by the config we've added to the `next.config.js`.

In order to export that page, these are the commands we've invoked:

```bash
npm run export
cd out
serve -p 8080
```

As you can see, there's no `npm run build` command. Why is that?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
