}

Next.js does automatic code splitting and it is based on the pages in your app. For example, if one of your modules is used at-least in half of your pages, then it moves into the main JavaScript bundle. If not, that module stays inside the page's bundle.

This is a pretty decent default setup. But sometimes, we need much better control for loading modules. For example, have a look at the following scenario, where:

- We are building a hacker news clone based on the [official firebase API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API),
- We fetch the data on the server to do SSR,
- We also fetch data in the client side when needed (when switching pages).

In this case, our main app bundle contains the [`firebase`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase) module, simply because it is used in all of our pages. It is a pretty big module. (More than the size of react, react-dom and next.js all combined)

But when it comes to client side, we only need it when the user starts navigating into a different page. So, if we can load the `firebase` module at that time, we can improve the initial loading of our app.

That is exactly what we are trying to do with this lesson.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
