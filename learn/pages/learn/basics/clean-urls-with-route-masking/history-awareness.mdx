import Layout from '~/components/Layout'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Clean URLs with Route Masking',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'clean-urls-with-route-masking',
  stepId: 'history-awareness'
}

## History Awareness

As you have witnessed, route masking works pretty nicely with the browser history.
All you have to do is just add the “as” prop for the link.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
