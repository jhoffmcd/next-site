import Layout from '~/components/Layout'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Lazy Loading Modules',
  courseId: 'excel',
  lessonId: 'lazy-loading-modules',
  stepId: 'test-results'
}

## Test Result

As you have witnessed, it only loads when you navigate a page for the first time. Here is what is actually happening.

At the first time, `getInitialProps` of the `pages/post.js` page imports the `firebase` module (via `lib/load-db.js`). So, the app loads the bundle.

Even the second time, `pages/index.js` page imports the `firebase` module. But at that time, it is already loaded and there is no reason to load it again.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
