We use a lot of React components in our applications. We include them in our main JavaScript bundle (`app.js`) or in one of the page's JavaScript bundles. Sometimes some of these components are pretty big.

For example, this is a pretty simple blog site we built with Next.js based on markdown.

It also supports syntax highlighting. For that, we use [react-highlight](https://github.com/akiran/react-highlight), and it's a pretty big module.

> Actually, the `react-highlight` module itself is very small but the [highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/) module used inside that is bulky.

Here's how we use it.

```jsx
import Highlight from 'react-highlight'

// some other code
;<div>
  <Highlight innerHTML>{marked(blogPostMarkdown)}</Highlight>
</div>

// some other code
```

Since it's used in almost all of the pages, `react-highlight` is included in our main JavaScript bundle.

But we don't need to use the syntax highlighter on every page. It's only needed when there's a code sample in the blog post.

So, if we can load react-highlight only when needed, that will reduce the initial app bundle dramatically, and that will help our app load faster.

This is something we can do with Next.js (since version 3.0).
Let's get started.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
