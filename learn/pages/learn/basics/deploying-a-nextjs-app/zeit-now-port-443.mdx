## ZEIT Now will always use 443

Even if you start your app on port 8000, once deployed to now, you can access it with port 443 (the default port for "https" websites).

That's a feature of â–²ZEIT Now. You only need to start your app on any port you like elsewhere. â–²ZEIT Now will map it to port 443 always.
